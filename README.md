# Next.js + Tailwind + Firebase with Google Auth and Firestore Integration

This is a starter repository for a web application using Next.js for server-side rendering, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Firebase for backend functionality, including Google authentication and storing user data on Cloud Firestore.

## Installation

To get started, first clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```


Then, install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```


You will also need to set up a Firebase project and configure it with your Google OAuth credentials. See the Firebase documentation for instructions on how to do this.

Once you have set up your Firebase project, create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables, replacing the values with your own:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=<your-auth-domain>
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=<your-storage-bucket>
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=<your-messaging-sender-id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=<your-app-id>
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=<your-client-email>
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-google-client-id>
```

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
